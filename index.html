      Welcome to my stealth game! You are represented by the blue disk
      <img src="player.png" style="height:12px; width:12px;" />.
      Your goal is to sneak into
      this military base, steal the treasure, and escape without being seen.

    <p>
      Move with the QWEADZXC keys. See the diagram. Press "S" to wait one turn. Moving into doors
      <img src="closedDoor.png" style="height:12px; width:12px;" />
      opens them.
      Click on doors while beside them to open or close them without moving.

      The map is randomly generated. One or more treasures, represented by yellow disks
      <img src="treasure.png" style="height:12px; width:12px;" />,
      are hidden inside buildings.
      They are protected by guards, represented by red triangles
      <img src="triangle0.png" style="height:12px; width:12px;" />,
      which point in the direction they're looking. When
      nearby guards move, you can hear their footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      You lose if a guard sees you. Be careful around windows
      <img src="window.png" style="height:12px; width:12px;" />.
      Move into a guard (when they don't
      see you) or click on them, while beside them, to kill them. Move into the treasure, or click on it while beside it,
      to take it. When you have collected all treasures,
      escape by running off the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Press "L" to make a noise, "luring" nearby guards to investigate. It is dangerous but useful.

Every tile has "walkable," "transparent," and "seen" as boolean attributes.
Every tile has an "open" attribute, but only relevant for doors
"seen" determines whether it is drawn to the map.

Every tile has an "interact" method. This is used to open/close doors.
